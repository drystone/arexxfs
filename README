Arexx tlx00 kernel module tested on debian 2.6.32 and 3.0.0 x86 kernel with
Arexx BS-500 USB data logger.

Installation:

# cd tlx00
# make
# insmod tlx00

When the arexx device is attached /sys/tlx00 dircetory appears. A subdirectory
of this is created for each sensor that is detected. This subdirectory is
named after the sensor's unique device id and inside is a file named 'raw'
which contains the raw reading from the sensor.

For example, to get raw data from device 9696:

#cat /sys/tlx00/9696/raw

For simple temperature sensors the raw value should be multiplied by 0.0078 to
get degrees celcius.
