fuse filesystem interface to the Arexx BS-500 data logger.

Depends on libusb (>=1.0) and libfuse (>=2.9)

To run
$ arexxfs <mountpoint>

A file is created in the mountpoint for each of the tempereature/humidity
sensors. These files contain the raw 4-digit hex reading from the sensors.

To convert the hex values to useful values see:

    "Further investigation shows us that we can calculate the measurements from
    RH sensors by (0.6 + Rawdata * 0.03328) RH%, from temperature sensors
    TSN-TH70E by (-39.58 + Rawdata * 0.01) °C and from temperature sensors
    TL-3TSN by (Rawdata * 0.0078) °C. These coefficients are based on the the
    following linear regressions. With more data they will slightly change, but
    given the accuracy and that you need to calibrate your sensors either way,
    it’s a sufficient translation of uncalibrated sensor data."
