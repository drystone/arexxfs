Arexx tlx00 kernel module tested on debian 2.6.32 x86 kernel with Arexx BS-500
USB data logger.

Installation:

# cd tlx00
# make
# insmod tlx00

When the arexx device is attached /sys/kernel/tlx00 dircetory appears. A
subdirectory of this is created for each sensor that is detected. This sub-
directory is named after the sensor's unique device id and inside is a file
named 'raw' which contains the raw reading from the sensor.

For example, to get raw data from device 9696:

#cat /sys/kernel/tlx00/9696/raw

For simple temperature sensors the raw value should be multiploed by 0.0078 to
get degrees celcius.

With thanks to Kornelius Rohmeyer for his work in decoding the tlx00 USB protocol:
